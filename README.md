# zipzop

A qtpy chat application

## Usage

First, get into the environment

`pipenv shell`

Now, start the server

`python src/server.py`

And run as many clients you like!

`python src/client.py &`

## Coming soon (or not)

- End-to-end encryption

- GraphQL: seems like a good learning opportunity to test GraphQL here

- Specific color for each client nickname (because why not?)
